My Take on Dataquest.io's Guided Project, investigating the proposed changes in Fandangos movie rating for the year 2016.

Is Fandango Still Inflating Ratings?

In October 2015, Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight published a popular article where he presented strong evidence which suggest that Fandango's movie rating system was biased and dishonest. In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.
